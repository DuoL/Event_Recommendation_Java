# Event recommendation system called 'Titan'
This web system has two main functions:  
	1. Find events around a user's geolocation within 50 miles;  
	2. Recommend events based on a user's favorites  

## WebPages [link](https://github.com/DuoL/Event_Recommendation_Java/blob/master/WebContent/)
There are only a few pages:
1. LoginPage
2. FrontPage
3. FavoritePage
4. RecommendPage  

## Database [link](https://github.com/DuoL/Event_Recommendation_Java/tree/master/src/db)
I used two kinds of DB 
	1. MySQL (for project purpose)
	2. MongoDB (extensible for MapReduce)


## Algorithm [link](https://github.com/DuoL/Event_Recommendation_Java/tree/master/src/algorithm)


## Items
Items will be based on the data we get from TicketMaster API  
So in a case there could be some attributes missing, we need a builder pattern to avoid creating so much constructors  

## External API
Here I used TicketMaster API, but this system is also extensible for other recommendations like Yelp API or NY times API
So Here I've used Factory pattern to make the API switchable for easy change in the future

## RPC
Java Servlets to handle different HTTP request
